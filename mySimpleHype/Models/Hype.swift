     ALL `init` (meaning memberwise and failable ones) must

 CKRecord is essentially a dictionary of key-value pairs BUT there are
 limitations to the types of values that can be assigned to keys. Currently
 the following are object types supported:
    - NSString
    - NSNumber
    - NSData
    - NSArray
    - CLLocation
    - CKAsset
    - CKRecord.Reference
 
 Notes on CKRecord
    CKRecord.Reference is only new Type that I should be unfamilar with. Still, it is easy
    to understand as it simply creates a link to a related record; the reference stores the
    ID of the target record.
    - The advantage of using a reference instead of storing the ID as a string is that
    - references can initiate cascade deletions of dependent records.
    - The disadvantage is that references can only link between records in the same
    - record zone, see CKRecord.Reference documentation for more
